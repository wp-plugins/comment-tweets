Comment Tweets gives you the ability to take the URL of a tweet and add it to the conversation on your blog.

== Description ==

Occassionally, readers will respond to your posts via tweets which is awesome, but when this happens, it's tough log the conversation between post comments and  the various tweets. This plugin aims to mitigate that problem!

Comment Tweets...

* Adds a set of fields below the post editor that allow you to paste the URL of a tweet
* Supports adding all of the tweets that you receive
* Allows you to remove tweets by simply removing the URL from the post editor
* Renders tweets in the order that they are listed
* Styles the Tweets using the Twitter API
